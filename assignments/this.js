/* The four principles of "this";
 * in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
 *
 * 1. Window Binding - When a function is declared in the global scope, the value of this inside that function will be the window object.
 * 2. Implicit Binding - When a method is called, 'this' refers to the object before the dot.
 * 3. New Binding - When a constructor function is used, 'this' refers to the specific instance of the object created and returned by the constructor function
 * 4. Explicit Binding - We can use object methods such as call or apply to explicity bind this to a specific object.
 *
 * write out a code example of each explanation above
